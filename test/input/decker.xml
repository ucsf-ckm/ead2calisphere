        <bioghist id="bioghist"><head>Biography/Administrative History</head><p>Bruce B. Decker (1950-1995), a Republican political consultant and public policy advocate, dedicated himself to AIDS research, education and treatment programs after learning he was HIV-positive in 1984. That same year, Decker helped found Concerned Americans for Individual Rights, a national organization of moderate and conservative gays and lesbians whose goal was to expand Republicans’ awareness of LGBT issues and counter the rising influence of the religious right. Governor George Dukemejian appointed Decker the first chair of the California AIDS Advisory Committee later that year; he resigned in 1988 after the governor announced his support for Proposition 102. Decker helped establish and promote the American Foundation for AIDS Research in 1985 and founded and was president of the Health Policy and Research Foundation, which coordinated long-term planning and funding for government and private-sector AIDS intervention projects. Decker lived in San Francisco from 1981-1987. He died of AIDS complications in Beverly Hills. He was 45.</p></bioghist>
