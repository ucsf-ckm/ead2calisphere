<head>Organizational History</head>
<p>The <emph render="italic">AIDS Legal Referral Panel</emph> (ALRP) provides access to free and low-cost legal services for people with HIV or an HIV-related legal problem. The panel also promotes the rights of people with HIV through its Public Policy Program.</p>
<p>ALRP originated in 1983 as a project of <emph render="italic">Bay Area Lawyers for Individual Freedom</emph> (BALIF), an organization of lesbian and gay lawyers. In 1985 Clint Hockenberry was hired as the staff person. In 1989 ALRP became an independent organization with Hockenberry as  Executive Director. He continued in this role until his death from AIDS in early 1992, at which time Kristin Chambers was appointed Executive Director. As the name implies, ALRP is primarily a referral service for people with legal problems related to AIDS. Callers are interviewed over the phone by ALRP staff to determine what issues are involved and what kind of help is needed. Clients are then matched with one of the hundreds of ALRP volunteer attorneys, paralegals, or notaries. Services are generally low cost or free. In 1992, 2,900 of the several thousand callers were referred to volunteers. ALRP also has a public policy arm which advocates for change in the legislative arena, in government entitlement programs (such as Social Security), and in other government agencies.</p>
